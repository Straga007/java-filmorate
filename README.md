**Project Description**

The project aims to develop a simple movie recommendation system and enhance the movie review functionality in an application. Additionally, it introduces features for tracking user activities and provides options for viewing top-rated movies, deleting movies and users, as well as filtering and searching movies.

**Task 1: Implementing a Movie Recommendation System**
- Develop a recommendation algorithm based on user likes and dislikes.
- Identify users with the highest number of overlapping likes.
- Recommend movies liked by similar users but not yet rated by the target user.

**Task 2: Enhancing Movie Reviews**
- Introduce review ratings and additional characteristics.
- Characteristics include usefulness, review type (positive/negative), and review rating.
- Enable sorting of reviews by usefulness rating.

**Task 3: Adding User Activity Feed**
- Implement a feature to display recent user activities such as friend additions, removals, likes, and reviews left by friends.
- Create a table to store user-related information like likes, friend additions, and reviews.

**Task 4: Top-N Movies Filter**
- Develop functionality to display top-N movies based on likes.
- Implement filtering by genre and release year.

**Task 5: Deleting Movies and Users**
- Introduce options to delete movies and users by their identifiers.

**Task 6: Adding Director Information to Movies**
- Enhance movie information with director names.
- Implement features to display all movies by a director sorted by likes and release years.

**Task 7: Common Movies with Friends**
- Implement functionality to display common movies with friends sorted by popularity.

**Task 8: Movie Search**
- Develop a search algorithm to search for movies by title and director.
- Enable substring search for titles and directors.
- Allow simultaneous search by title and director.

Each task corresponds to specific API endpoints for adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving data. The project follows a structured approach to enhance the movie recommendation and review system while providing additional features for user interaction and content management.
